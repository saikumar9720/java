Building blocks of Java:

JDK, JRE, JVM:


JDK: Java Development Kit provides different libraries (jar files) for application
Development. 

JDK also provides few internal tools such as java, javac, javap etc used for 
application development. 

JRE:  Java Runtime Environment provides an environment to run java applications. 

JRE also contains the required jar files. 

JVM: Java Virtual Machine is a part of JRE and will be invoked using java command. 

ex:   java Hello  

JVM gets invoked when a file is being executed. 

Java is an Object Oriented Programming Language which means all the implementation 
goes through classes.


class FirstApp123{
public static void main(String args[]){
     System.out.println("Hello");
 }
}

javac FirstApp123.java 

java FirstApp123
